**Turn ArXiv Papers into Markdown with One Click**

Are you tired of wrestling with PDFs when you need to analyze or excerpt research papers? In the age of LLMs, having clean, accessible text is more important than ever. The ArXiv Markdown Parser Chrome extension is built to streamline your research workflow by converting arXiv papers into clean, readable Markdown with a single click.

> Note: Currently the extension only supports papers with an HTML version. Most of the new papers have an HTML version but some are not. [It's a beta feature of ArXiv](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html) and more papers will be supported in the future.

## Overview

The ArXiv Markdown Parser is designed to simplify the process of extracting content from arXiv papers. Whether you're conducting literature reviews, performing detailed analyses, or integrating research into LLM workflows, this extension helps you bypass the cumbersome process of PDF extraction. Instead, it converts the entire paperâ€”including equations, tables, figures, and internal referencesâ€”into well-structured Markdown, making it easier to read, share, and annotate.

### Why Markdown Matters

- **LLM Integration:** Markdown text is much easier to feed into LLMs like ChatGPT. By bypassing the messy PDF extraction process, you ensure that models receive clean, structured inputâ€”ideal for summarization, translation, or analysis.
- **Fast Table & Equation Copying:** Research papers often contain complex tables and equations. Converting to Markdown allows you to quickly copy and paste these elements into your notes or LLM prompts without formatting issues.
- **Seamless Collaboration:** Markdown is one of the most popular formats for academic and technical documentation. Its compatibility with version control systems (like Git) makes it perfect for group research settings, collaborative wikis, or shared repositories.

## Features

- **One-Click Conversion:** Simply open any arXiv paper (abs, pdf, or html) and click the extension icon to instantly convert the content into Markdown.
- **Customizable Output:** Choose whether to include a table of contents and references in your Markdown output.
- **Enhanced Research Workflow:** Quickly extract and organize key components of research papers for rapid summarization, annotation, or further analysis.
- **Improved Equation Handling:** Easily obtain LaTeX or Markdown versions of equations for use in your notes, presentations, or LLM prompts.
